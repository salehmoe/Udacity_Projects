# Project 1 of the Data Analyst Nano-degree

### Goals for the project

Getting some practice with the Pandas and Numpy modules in python


### Details
In the jupyter notebook we went through some of the main features of the Pandas and Numpy modules mainly Pandas. We practice how to import the data from csv into data frame of pandas. We practiced how to select couloums or rows, and the index allocation from Pandas. In addition we used some statistic features of the two modules like the mean and the standard deviation. We also explored how the two modules deals with the NaN values in the array (array) or Series (Pandas). We also did some plotting using the Matplot module (histogram distributions).


### 3. Possible improvement or suggestion to the project

There are plenty of features in the two modules. Using if these features depend on the problem or the question we want to answer. In the meantime the notebook includes some of the features used but we will probably use this notebook in the future for further exploration of the data set used.
